[z-Tran](https://github.com/econdojo/ztran) is a software that Fei Tan and Jieran Wu developed for implementing our analytic policy function iteration algorithm. To avoid misinterpretation about its contributors, we have updated the software's copyright notice (see below) under the BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License. We thank Zhao Han for testing the software on various models and providing helpful user feedback.
