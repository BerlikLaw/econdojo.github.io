My research agenda is organized around three areas: `macroeconomics`, `Bayesian statistics`, and `evolutionary dynamics`. One line of my recent research develops frequency-domain approaches to solving dynamic incomplete information models with applications to monetary and fiscal policy. Another line develops Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for estimating high-dimensional dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. I also conduct research on the evolution of cooperative and altruistic human behavior.

Currently, I teach [ECON 3120](/courses/e3120/) Intermediate Macroeconomics, [ECON 4310](/courses/e4310/) International Macroeconomics, and [ECON 6xx0](/courses/e6xx0/) Applied Bayesian Statistics at Saint Louis University.
