My research agenda is organized around three areas: `macroeconomics`, `Bayesian statistics`, and `evolutionary dynamics`. One line of my recent research develops frequency-domain approaches to solving dynamic incomplete information models with applications to monetary and fiscal policy. Another line develops Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for estimating high-dimensional dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. I also conduct research on the evolution of cooperative and altruistic human behavior.

Currently, I teach macroeconomics and econometrics at Saint Louis University.
