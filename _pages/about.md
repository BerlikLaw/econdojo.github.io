My research agenda is organized around three areas: `macroeconomics`, `Bayesian statistics`, and `evolutionary dynamics`. One line of my recent research develops frequency-domain approaches to solving and analyzing dynamic incomplete information models with applications to monetary economics and finance. Another line develops Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for estimating high-dimensional models adopted by central banks. I also conduct research on the evolution of cooperative and altruistic human behavior.

Currently, I teach macroeconomics and econometrics at Saint Louis University. Meanwhile, I am available on the industry job market for data scientist positions. I am also a thematic investor for space economy and have rich experience in derivative trading.
