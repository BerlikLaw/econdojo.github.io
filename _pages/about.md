My research agenda is organized around three areas: `macroeconomics`, `Bayesian statistics`, and `evolutionary dynamics`. One line of my recent research develops frequency-domain approaches to solving dynamic incomplete information models with applications to monetary and fiscal policy. Another line develops Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for estimating high-dimensional dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. I also conduct research on the evolution of cooperative and altruistic human behavior.

Currently, I am teaching [ECON 3120](/courses/e3120/) Intermediate Macroeconomics in Fall and [ECON 4310](/courses/e4310/) International Macroeconomics in Spring. I am also organizing the Chaifetz School Friday Research/Teaching [seminar series](/misc/seminar/).

Please send an email to me if you have any difficulty with links or downloads from this homepage.
