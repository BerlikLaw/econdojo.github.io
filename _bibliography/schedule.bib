  title={Don't Trash That Product, Upcycle It: Examining Consumer Evaluations of Companies That Upcycle (Working with Doctoral Students)},
  author={Katie Kelting},
  abstract={Environmental responsibility is of growing importance to consumers. As such, more and more companies are strategically investing in environmental responsibility production and promoting such an endeavor. One emerging trend among companies is to upcycle or create a product of greater value from a discarded product of lesser value. Given its novelty, very little is known about the effectiveness of upcycling as a marketing strategy, especially from a consumer-perspective. Thus, I seek to examine how consumers evaluate companies that participate and invest in upcycling programs. (Besides presenting her very interesting research on consumer evaluations of upcycling companies that won her the Summer Research Grant, Katie is also sharing her insights on working with doctoral students based on her experience of advising and mentoring doctoral students.)},
