[z-Tran](https://github.com/econdojo/ztran) is a MATLAB toolbox that we developed for implementing our analytic policy function iteration (APFI) algorithm&mdash;an algorithm that builds the algorithm for solving dynamic incomplete information models.<d-footnote>To avoid misinterpretation about the software's contributors, we have updated the copyright notice (see GitHub host) under the BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License.</d-footnote> All of the routines are coded in MATLAB as object-oriented programs. However, z-Tran does not require the user to have any prior knowledge of object-oriented programming. Indeed, it is quite intuitive to use as you will quickly realize when running our demo code.

More technicalities to follow soon.
